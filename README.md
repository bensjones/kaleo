kaleo is a social list sharing application that i am working on.  use kaleo to plan a party with friends, 
prepare for a group trip, or for anything that involves multiple people collaborating on a single set of tasks.

the application is written in javascript using meteor.js web framework and is served from an ubuntu instance running nginx.  
meteor.js supports web socketing, so changes in data are immediately reflected on all shared users' browser without a page 
refresh.
